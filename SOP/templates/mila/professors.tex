I believe that MILA stands head-and-shoulders above the alternatives as a place to pursue my interests. The wealth of experienced and knowledgeable faculty members gives me confidence that no matter who my supervisor may be, I will have the opportunity to conduct meaningful research and experience a high-quality education.

That said, when considering potential advisors, there are a few whose work and interests particularly stand out to me. I have previously spoken to Siva Reddy, with whom I share interests in representation learning, bias, and interpretability. His work on question answering over knowledge bases is closely related to my coursework in CSI5180. William Hamilton has studied patterns of conflict and language use in online communities, which is an area I particularly hope to explore in my graduate studies. Relatedly, Reihaneh Rabbany currently supervises work centered around the detection of malicious Twitter users in discourse surrounding the Canadian federal election, an exciting area closely related to my senior thesis. I would be thrilled to work with any of them, as well as many other members of the faculty. Thank you again for your consideration.
