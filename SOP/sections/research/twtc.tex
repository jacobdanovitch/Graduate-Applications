In baseball, a scouting report is a written profile about a player describing their characteristics and traits, usually intended for use in player valuation. I constructed and open-sourced a novel dataset of nearly 10,000 scouting reports for amateur baseball players in order to predict whether each player would be successful from just their written profile. I implemented a variety of models such as the Hierarchical Attention Network \cite{Yang2016HierarchicalAN}, and countered class imbalance (as most players fail to make the major leagues) using a weighted loss function and data augmentation. This work integrated my research interests with one of my favourite pastimes, and was published after finishing as a finalist in the reproducible research competition at the 2019 Carnegie Mellon Sports Analytics Conference \cite{danovitch2019trouble}.
