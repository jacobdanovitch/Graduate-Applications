Carleton's accelerated masters program has afforded me the opportunity to experience two graduate courses. It has been invaluable learning the theory behind concepts like the attention mechanism and Siamese networks in COMP5900X (Advanced Machine Learning), and about knowledge representation for both structured and unstructured data in CSI5180 (Topics in Artificial Intelligence). I most enjoyed developing a search engine in CSI4107 (Information Retrieval), with each lecture introducing a new component to the system such as K-Means clustering, Na√Øve Bayes, or word embeddings. %I hope to pursue similar learning experiences at \universityname. \input{templates/\template/courses.tex}

% Courses such as \note{(WHATEVER COURSES)} greatly interest me \note{(AND HERE'S WHY)}.
