When I initially struggled in high school programming, my teacher worked with me every single day during lunch until it finally clicked. This experience tremendously influenced my work as a teaching assistant and interest in becoming a professor. I have previously TA'd courses such as COMP 1005 (Introduction to Computer Science I),  COMP1805 (Discrete Structures I), and COMP2406 (Introduction to Web Development), with the goal of introducing students to computing concepts with the same enthusiasm my teacher did for me. This semester, I have had the unique opportunity to TA the graduate course \textit{Storytelling with Data}, which promotes literacy in data science concepts for journalism students. I introduced data collection methods like web scraping and used topic modelling to help the students draw insights from a large dataset of political advertisements on Facebook related to the Canadian federal election.
