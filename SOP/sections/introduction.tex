My primary research interest is the use of machine learning to develop our understanding of natural language, with an emphasis on social discourse. Following my graduate studies, my goal is to remain in academia as a professor or to find employment as a research scientist.

There was no single, grand moment at which this suddenly became clear to me; simply put, my experience was best described by Hemingway's passage above. My interest steadily increased until, before I knew it, studying natural language became my answer to \inlinequote{Where do you see yourself in 10 years?}. I became interested in the field when I first learned about the work done by \cite{bedi2015automated} to correctly forecast the onset of psychosis in adolescents. This motivated me to learn about what enables us to draw such important insights from our language, and it quickly became clear that deeply understanding these mechanisms was something I was truly passionate about. With that in mind, the following statement describes how I've pursued these passions, and how completing a \degree {} at \universityname {}  will enable me to continue doing so.
